**tourist** - _noun;_ a person who is traveling, especially for pleasure.

**local** - _noun;_ a local person or resident.

**photograper** - _noun;_ a person who takes photographs, either as a hobby or a profession.

The summer of 2012 was spent as both a tourist and as a local, photographing both other tourists and other locals
on the Isle of Mull, Scotland, in London, and in Paris. Sometimes it is obvious who is local to a place and who
is just visiting; other times, not so much.

141 pictures from that summer were assembled as a book, *Toursist and Locals*, available to download as a [PDF file](/books/Tourists-and-Locals.pdf).
Only a small subset of the photographs contained in the book are offered above. In recognition that the experience of viewing
images on the web is not the same as that of turning the pages of a book, the selection and ordering of the pictures here has
been tailored for online viewing.

If you do download the book, note that it was designed to be viewed two pages at a time, with the left page speaking to
the right page and vice versa. Adobe Acrobat, and other sophisticated PDF viewers, can be configured to display two pages
side-by-side; if you have the screen space to do this, it will provide something close to the intended conversations
between the images.
