No longer was this color in the numinous Kodachrome landscapes I had sought out for my first 30 years wielding a 
camera, but now on the streets, in the fairgrounds, in the museums, with people large in the frame rather than 
painstakingly excluded. And looking back through my files, I found there had always been some moments where my 
faltering courage had been sufficient to focus on some person instead of pine trees - there were people among 
the landscapes.
