footnote: The book was designed to be viewed two pages at a time, with the left page speaking to the right page and vice versa; if
          you have the screen space to view it that way, with Adobe Acrobat or similar, that will provide something close to
          the intended conversation with the images.

The petroglyphs and worn paths in the rock mesa of Tsankawi, New Mexico, deny the permanence of New York City, of the art in our museums,
the significance of our busy lives.
