>The photograph isn’t what was photographed. It’s something else. It’s a new fact.

> ~ Gary Winogrand, quoted in [The Man In The Crowd](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Crowd-Uneasy-Streets-Winogrand/dp/1881337057)

> Photography developed a fugitive poetics in the 1940s and ‘50s, ... In this mode the photographer comes across scenes, instants and installations which suggest meanings which are hard to put one’s finger on.

>"And this, too, shall pass away." How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction! "And this, too, shall pass away."

> ~ Abraham Lincoln, _The Milwaukee Speach_

Carved and worn into the rocks of Tsankawi, New Mexico, the petroglyphs and paths made by a people lost to history
ask questions about the permanence of New York City and of the art in our museums. We, and the photographs that we
make, are but a passing presence.

The images here are a selection taken from a book, *A Passing Presence*, that can be downloaded as a [PDF file](/books/A-Passing-Presence.pdf).
If you do download the book, note that it was designed to be viewed two pages at a time, with the left page speaking to the right
page and vice versa. Adobe Acrobat, and other sophisticated PDF viewers, can be configured to display two pages side-by-side;
if you have the screen space to do this, it will provide something close to the intended conversations between the images.
