Not a collection with any theme or purpose, not yet at least, just a collection of recent images ...

That said, as things stand in January, 2023, all these pictures are of patrons at Austin's [Elephant Room](https://elephantroom.com/)
"underground jazz bar," made on one evening. They could be the start of a series around jazz, nightlife, or people 
alone and together in bars, or just lost in their phones.
