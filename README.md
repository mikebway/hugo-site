# Hugo Site Generator for mikebroadway.com

<mikebroadway.com> is a static web site, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) storage.

The site layout is derived from the [Newsroom Hugo Theme](https://github.com/onweru/newsroom), designed and developed by [wero](https://github.com/onweru).

## Running Locally

As with any normal [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) project, the site can be run locally at <http://localhost:1313/> using the folowing command in the project root:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

The `-D` switch will include any draft pages.

## Deploying to S3

The site must first be built into the `/public` directory with the undecorated `hugo` command:

```bash
hugo
```

Then the contents of the `/public` directory myst be synced to the target S3 bucket:

```bash
. ./sync.sh
```

Naturally, you must first have established access keys for the `aws s3 sync` to work!
